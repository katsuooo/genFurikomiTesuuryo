In Blazor Server you can use ReadAllText("wwwroot/data/Users.json");
In Blazor WebAssembly you don't provide the wwwroot/ part but since ReadAllText() is not supported there it doesn't really matter.
Under WebAssembly you can await Http.GetStringAsync("data/Users.json");
Check FetchData.razor and weather.json for a full example.
